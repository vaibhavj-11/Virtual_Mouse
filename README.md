# Virtual_Mouse
A fun little project that I learned from YouTube. It uses OpenCV based on Python.
Hand Tracking Module tracks hands and we use the data to create a virtual mouse.

To try it out:
1.) Donwnload the files and unzip it.
2.) Use Pycharm to open the Virtual_Mouse.py.
3.) Run the code and keep your hand spread out infront of the camera.
4.) Single finger up means that you can move around the mouse, double finger up to stop the cursor at the required position and bring the two open fingers together to click.

Packages required
1.) OpenCV-python
2.) mediapipe

Recommended IDE
1.) Pycharm
